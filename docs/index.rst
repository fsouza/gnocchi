Welcome to Gnocchi's documentation!
===================================

**Gnocchi** is a Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection (IoC/DI) container for PHP. The main goal of the project is to provide a powerful tool for PHP framework (as MVC frameworks).

The project started from an idea: bring the power of some MVC frameworks (like `VRaptor <http://vraptor.caelum.com.br>`_) to PHP, including features like dependency injection, annotation URL mapping and other powerful stuffs. The MVC project was named Bread, and **Gnocchi** is one of Bread's components.
